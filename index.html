    <h1><a href="/2012/06/why-enterprise-software-sucks-at-ui.html">Why Enterprise Software Sucks At UI</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I've spent a lot of time around enterprise software. I've used it as part of many jobs, I've purchased it from vendors, and I've built custom applications on top of enterprise software, and produced enterprise software for corporate clients. And I've hated every enterprise UI I've ever seen.</p>
<p>As with many things, monetary incentives drive the form  that enterprise software takes. Just as most software isn't very secure because people can't measure security, enterprise customers won't pay for good UI work. And it's not because the buyers <em>dislike</em> good UI, it's because they don't measure it and don't try.</p>
<p>This is because the purchaser for enterprise software is almost never the final user. They collect a matrix of interests and needs that the product has to fulfill, and then judge different vendor products against the matrix. The IT department needs the product to integrate with all the other crappy software they use. The compliance department needs it to be certified with any regulations or standards that apply. Risk Management needs to know the vendor is a going concern and not likely to go under. Everyone has a column they need to put a tick mark in. The most tick marks gets the sale.</p>
<p>The group of people who would <em>use</em> the software is often represented by a manager one or two levels away from the actual users. There are often literally no actual users present when it is evaluated and the choice is made. Even if there is a single user, there's no veto for a shitty UI like there is for missing a regulation. This just doesn't make it random whether or not the chosen software has a good UI, it drives the market to spend less and less on UI.</p>
<p>Vendors know how purchasing decisions are made, and which missing tick marks will cost them a sale. So all development is oriented towards those features. And once the software is purchased it's very expensive to move away, so people will put up with poor UIs as a matter of practice. Managers will tell you it's your job to use the software — it's not supposed to be fun or delightful.</p>
<p>This is how enterprise software is guaranteed to have poor UI: any dollars and development time going to UI is <em>taken</em> from some feature that one of these enterprise customers need to tick a mark on a comparison sheet. UI work can cost a sale. As long as buyers never ask and can't measure how productive a UI is in a demo, vendors will never spend money on it.</p>
<p>This is another reason I like <a href="/2012/05/simplify-business-models.html">simpler business models</a>. In this case, that would mean the purchaser should also be the user of the software, to make sure you're actually incented to delight the <em>users</em> of the software, not just the <em>purchasers</em> of it.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/06/iads-should-fail.html">iAds Should Fail</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>Apple's iAds program hasn't done very well. They promised to make advertising <em>not suck</em>. It's worth noting that the goal was to make advertising better for <em>device owners</em> rather than advertisers.</p>
<p>I love that the iAd program isn't doing well, because it means that Apple respects their device-buying customers more than their advertising customers.</p>
<p>Advertising <a href="/2012/05/simplify-business-models.html">always complicates business models</a> by adding conflicting demands on the producer. To the extent that ads are better for device/app/blog customers, they are generally worse for advertisers. Advertisers almost uniformly believe that intrusiveness and pushiness is effective.</p>
<p>So Apple's goal of making ads better for device owners is not likely to thrive, because advertisers won't want to pay a premium for something they believe to be less effective. This could have resulted in two outcomes: Apple could increasingly make ads more intrusive and pushy in order to make the iAd platform successful for advertisers, or it could wither on the vine, because they refuse to put out distracting, pushy ads.</p>
<p>The fact that the iAd platform sucks means that Apple is committed to serving their device customers more than advertisers. And that's the best result I can imagine.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/greed-isnt-the-issue.html">Greed Isn't The Issue</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I tend to roll my eyes when people blame a high price on corporate greed. It's especially roll-worthy when these same people go comparison shopping on sites all over the world to get the lowest price for something.</p>
<p>A transaction has two sides, each side trying to get the best deal. For the buyer, it means getting the most product for your money. For the seller, it means getting the most money for your product.</p>
<p>It's terribly hypocritical for a person on one side of the transaction to maximize their return (say, by comparison shopping), but denigrate a seller's effort to maximize by charging what the market will bear. I'm not talking about defrauding people. I'm just talking about charging what people will pay.</p>
<p>People engaged in economic activity will try to make sure they get the best deal they can reasonably find, or at least will choose transactions they think aren't ripoffs (which is the same thing). That way, when both parties agree on a sale, both feel like they are better off for having made the transaction. One party wanted the item more than their money, and the other wanted the money more than the item. So they exchanged. That's how it works.</p>
<p>It's one of the beautiful symmetries in life that it works the same no matter which side of the transaction you're on. The fact that <em>each person feels they've gained</em> by the trade is why it works. Mutual exchange for mutual benefit is the basis for specialization and a society with all our modern conveniences. And I <em>like</em> modern conveniences.</p>
<p>So the real issue isn't "greed" at all, since that would describe anyone trying to get the most for their money as well. A proper morality is not some naïve and self-contradictory altruism. Blaming anything on "greed" is a sign that a person needs to work out a better moral understanding of themselves and the people around them.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/simplify-business-models.html">Simplify Business Models</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>There's something pure about the simple "two-party sale" business model: a customer pays money to a producer to purchase a product. It's a one-time transaction. The entire value the producer gets is the agreed price. The entire value for the customer is the product. The producer gets the money outright, and the customer gets the product outright. Assuming there is no fraud or defect in the product or the payment, there is no more to the transaction.</p>
<p>It's <em>pure</em> because it's easy to understand. And as either a customer or a producer, it's easy to "calculate" the value you need out of the transaction. Producers can figure out what minimum price they need to make enough profit to continue their operations, and what maximum price the market will bear. Each customer can imagine the use they have for the product, and decide what cash value they're willing to part with to get it. There are very few variables, and each party can understand the variables they need to enter into a transaction.</p>
<h1>It's Often Not That Simple</h1>
<p>There are few businesses with such simple models. The stickers and adware on new PCs are ugly, user-hostile reminders that the PC-maker has other customers than the person who buys the computer. Product placement in TV and movies are reminders that producers had other customers than the audience to please.</p>
<p>The principle is that another source of revenue represents another customer with unique needs. This means your project isn't just serving a single "job to be done". Whenever you get away from the pure model of 1 customer and 1 producer per transaction, you get complicated interactions of what jobs different people are hiring your product to do. Like waves in a pool they can interact in interesting ways.</p>
<h1>Advertising Complicates Transactions</h1>
<p>Advertising makes for an antagonistic interaction of the jobs to be done by each customer. Take blogging as an example. The advertiser is a customer of the blogger, along with the reader. The reader pays no money for articles, but he does pay with his attention. Attention won't pay the blogger's bills, but it can be resold to advertisers. The advertiser gets no real value from the producer's product, but they will pay for the reader's attention. Except the reader doesn't need the advertisement. At all.</p>
<p>Without the reader, the advertiser doesn't care. Without the advertiser, the producer can't get enough cash out of readers. It's a tenuous balance.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that some customers get ignored with all these interacting expectations? I have always been involved in business with complex customer-producer relationships, and the complexity has been problematic in each one. Even if the serving one customer doesn't directly hurt another (and often it does), it will at the very least take focus. </p>
<p>No one expects all relationships to be easy, but I will keep this in mind the next business that I start: I would like a clear relationship where all my customers have the same job to be done.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/first-order-management.html">First-Order Management</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>The great thing about learning a principle is applying it to new and novel problems. I often get to apply principles from system architecture to my newer challenges in organizational and management problems.</p>
<p>I have recently been thinking about how principles in performance optimization of programs can sometimes apply to the performance of people. I'll introduce the principle as I learned it, and then apply it to a common management problem.</p>
<h1>Optimization Is Hard</h1>
<p>There are a class of very common errors that developers often make when diagnosing performance problems. A well-meaning developer will hook up a profiler to a problematic bit of code to see what routines are taking too much time. They'll pick a routine that has a large  percent of runtime, and try to tweak the code to get it to run faster. Many of these tweaks only work for special case data, or on special case hardware, or need special compiler treatment. And often they only provide a few percentage points of improvement.</p>
<p>The experienced developers have learned that there is a way to get much better improvements over a larger set of circumstances. Algorithmic and architecture changes regularly offer improvements an order of magnitude better than the original solution. The answer to a slow piece of code is often not to run it at all. As a simplified example, instead of speeding up ten slow database calls, it may be possible to rewrite the program to just use one call, or even eliminate runtime database lookups entirely.</p>
<p>The problem with the profiler method is <em>using a solution that's easy to measure, but not the most impactful</em>. A profiler won't tell you about the health of your algorithm or architecture. It won't reveal a new O(n log n) solution to your problem instead of the O(n**2) one that you're trying to speed up.</p>
<h1>The Principle</h1>
<p>In system development, you learn that algorithms and architectures are first-order determinants of program performance, and detailed implementation tricks are lower-order. The principle is to <em>exhaust first-order solutions before spending time on the less impactful lower-order solutions</em>.</p>
<h1>Management Reports Are Profilers</h1>
<p>The same trap catches managers, and in the same way. They have tools to measure some aspects of performance of practitioners, projects, or whole departments. Like code profilers, they only measure the people that are there (as opposed to the people that <em>could</em> be there), and they only measure things that are easy to measure; there is no number for skill or teamwork. </p>
<p>In software development, the <em>people</em>&thinsp;—&thinsp;their skills and teamwork&thinsp;—&thinsp;are a first order determinant of project success. Choosing the right people is as important as choosing the right algorithm in software development: you can literally get ten times the performance with a better choice.</p>
<p>But often managers only consider the easily measurable metrics produced by their team. You can produce a 10% increase in an underperforming practitioner by sending them to a course. They learn a thing or two, come back unburdened and recharged, and they try harder for a time. Maybe. But if that person produces one tenth of the person you <em>could</em> hire, then it's not the best use of management effort.</p>
<p>But, like the developer with the profiling report, these managers can show small percentage increases in their chosen metric. Also like the developer, there is no report that shows the tenfold increase possible only to a different approach. It's easy to measure training days, and correlate it to a minor percent increase in code commits. It's easy, but it's not the most effective strategy.</p>
<h1>What To Do?</h1>
<p>So what is a manager to do? You don't throw away your metrics. In any business you need some type of metrics, and they should be directly linked to the firm's profitability. But you should figure out what are first-order determinants of those results, and manage those, even if they're hard or impossible to measure.</p>
<p>Don't commit to metrics that are too limiting. If you measure training days, you're buying into the idea that training days is a worthwhile eventual indicator of profitability. You could manage that brilliantly and still fail, because training days are a minor determinant of success compared with skill and teamwork. Picking a wider measurement such as "project success" or "revenue" will enable you to make decisions more broadly about your first-order factors. That way you're not painted into a corner or managing the wrong variables.</p>
<p>And if you're an IT Manager, spend as much time as possible on getting the right people, and getting rid of the wrong people. The "right" people might be hard to measure on a report, but you're better off focusing on it as best you can instead of micro-managing metrics that hardly matter.</p>
