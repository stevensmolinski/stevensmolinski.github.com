    <h1><a href="/2014/02/cooler-and-harder.html">Cooler and Harder</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>In 2011, Merlin Mann <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk0hSeQ5s_k">talked about being scared</a> about making cool stuff, and doing cool things. And how we should be stopped from doing harder and cooler things just because we're scared. Everyone is scared, even the successful. Back then I was making things, but they weren't as cool as I liked, and they were locked up behind a corporate wall. Merlin's talk inspired me to be scared of bigger and better things.</p>
<p>Instead of enterprise problems, I'm going to help with problems of actual people. Success won't be a number on a spreadsheet, but a smile on someone's face. That's cool.</p>
<p>Instead of locking up my work inside a corporate owner, I'm going to work on something with a wider audience, out on the open web, where it will stand for itself. That's also cool.</p>
<p>I'm going to use my best judgment, instead of trying to achieve consensus among tens of stakeholders. I'm going to sweat user experience details, even the ones that don't have a measurable ROI. I'm going to use modern technology. I'm going to try and delight my customers.</p>
<p>And I'm not going to have an evil business model. I'm going to make something that people like enough to pay for it. I'm not going to sell anyone up the river.</p>
<p>I expect this to be a hard road. My goal is to work on hard but rewarding problems. At least I know I'll be half right; I'm still only projecting the rewarding part.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/10/withdrawal.html">iPhone Withdrawal</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I don't want to be cliché, but I had to spend a half hour without my phone and it was a bit unsettling. I learned two things, and like most things I learn, both things just opened up more questions.</p>
<h2>Apple Stores Are Awesome</h2>
<p>I learned that Apple stores are wondrous places for customers, quite opposite to most of my experiences as a customer. I had your relatively typical Genius Bar experience, in that I got better service than I expected, and walked away happy.</p>
<p>The speaker on my iPhone 5 had stopped working just that morning, and I had a flight to catch at 1pm. There were no open Genius Bar appointments before my flight left. I went to the store anyway, and pleaded my case. They managed to fit me in and fix my problem with time to spare, all with a smile.</p>
<p>The more interesting questions are around why all customer experiences aren't similar. Marketing budgets are set around how much it costs to get a new customer, but this no-questions-asked service from Apple retains a customer at a fraction of that cost. Great service makes Apple's products stand out even farther than their build quality and design details. The customer experience turns regular people into evangelists to their friends and family. You can't buy that sort of marketing on TV — it comes one customer at a time, paid for with a good retail experience.</p>
<p>So if most businesses are also staring down the large cost of wooing a new customer, why aren't they spending their time carefully crafting the customer experience to keep customers and turn them into walking advertisements? I have guesses, but that's a much bigger topic for another time.</p>
<h2>Am I Addicted To Computing?</h2>
<p>The Apple Genius joked that I had to spend a half hour amusing myself while he replaced the speaker in my iPhone. This is a solid half hour, with literally nothing to do, and no technology whatsoever. He suggested an actual dead-tree newspaper at the coffee shop two doors down, if I were so inclined. </p>
<p>"Remember newspapers?" </p>
<p>"Kind of."</p>
<p>I did go to the coffee shop, but forewent the newspaper. As a big boy with a functioning brain, I should be capable of amusing myself for a half hour. After purchasing a coffee and finding a seat, it took roughly thirty seconds before reflexively reaching into the "iPhone pocket" twice. Not as strong as I had hoped, I snatched my coffee and walked through the mall, hoping that there were enough distracting ladies to keep me amused for … ugh. Twenty. Five. More. Minutes.</p>
<p>Canadians have had the iPhone since the 3G in July, 2008. People like me haven't spent a half-hour without a personal network-connected computer for 4 years and 3 months. That's long enough to build some habits. </p>
<p>It's generally not interesting to read articles about Internet addiction or information addiction. But what I do find interesting is what level of personal computing we should want in our lives. When you realize you're used to having information, communication, and entertainment readily at hand 24 hours a day, is the right reaction to be aghast and to cut down? Or is the right thing to welcome it and hope for smaller, wristwatch sized iPhones next year?</p>
<p>What's interesting is not the reliance on personal computing, but if a modern moral framework will evaluate it as a good thing or not. Was that helpful Apple Genius helping me to have a better life, or a peddler of dependence, giving me a hit for free? That's also a much bigger issue to leave for another day.</p>
<p>(Spoiler: I'll bet they're perfectly moral.)</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/09/Less Bullshit, More Autonomy.html">Less Bullshit and More Autonomy</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I've been exploring the option to work in smaller organizations instead of larger ones because I want less bullshit and more autonomy. That's not just me swearing, it's a very precise statement.</p>
<h2>Too Much Bullshit</h2>
<p>I divide work tasks into three broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Product.</strong> Designing, creating, running, supporting, and maintaining a product that does a job that customers need done.</li>
<li><strong>Support.</strong> Work necessary to support the business that makes the product: accounting, marketing and sales, supply management, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Bullshit.</strong> If it's not in #1 or #2, then it's just bullshit. It can take many forms: useless paperwork, building bridges to unqualified gatekeepers, compensating for poor performers, you name it.</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal is to spend as much time as possible on product, as little time as necessary on support, and <em>exactly zero</em> time on bullshit.</p>
<p>This is where large corporate jobs often fall down. There are stories about new hires that wait for days or weeks to get access to the system they need to perform their job. New processes tend to accrete in a large organization; every problem generates a new form, gate, meeting, or approver. People can impose huge burdens to gather and report data on others with a single sentence email. Designers I worked with used to calculate that they often spent less than two hours per day on product, a few hours a week on support, and the great majority of their time on bullshit.</p>
<h2>Not Enough Autonomy</h2>
<p>Decision-making in large organizations is often dysfunctional. Few executives understand delegation. They retain approval on minutia often without understanding the effort (i.e., cost) involved in gaining approval from someone without any time or domain knowledge.</p>
<p>Organizational structure will always place a large number of constraints on a product designer. The product has to perform the customer's job but also it must be profitable, be saleable through a channel, meet regulatory approval, etc. But those constraints can be met with low or high friction processes. </p>
<p>Low friction would be to educate and delegate responsibility to meet all these factors to the lead product designer. For example, a Privacy Compliance office could send a representative to describe privacy requirements and to help the product designer understand compliance issues. These emissaries would act as advisors and contributors. This method leaves the product designer in the driver's seat, even though other groups help to set the road.</p>
<p>Sadly what often happens is for each group to impose a gate on the product design process. Each group wants a veto. Each group wants to be brought up to speed on the whole product in order to evaluate it. Instead of advisors guiding the lead designer, you get a committee of people who are only empowered to say "no". This method places the constraints <em>above</em> the product design process itself.</p>
<h2>The Full Picture</h2>
<p>If your focus is on helping customers, then you will want to focus on product. Too often corporate jobs are less than 10% product, and even then you're navigating a gauntlet of managers who are only allowed to stop development. These are not organizations with a <a href="http://dangerinc.ca/2011/03/effort-culture-vs-product-culture.html">product culture</a>.</p>
<p>These jobs may pay for 40 hours per week, but you feel like you've done 4 hours of good work, and spend the other 36 getting permission to do it. So to be <em>productive</em>, I suggest finding organizations with less bullshit and more autonomy. That's what I'm doing.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/all-chefs-and-no-cooks.html">All Chefs and No Cooks</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>You can ruin any endeavour by over or under-specialization. While this lesson gets easily lost in corporate technology projects, it's pretty obvious in cooking. No one would staff a 200 table restaurant with one employee per table, waiting, cooking, mixing drinks, and bussing the table. You'd wait forever for meals, and they'd be inconsistent at best. On the other extreme, no one would assemble a chef, sous-chef, and three line cooks to make a bowl of cereal.</p>
<h2>Under-specialized</h2>
<p>For a small, growing company, the tendency is under-specialization. People go on "wearing many hats" for longer than is practical — waiting too long to get someone good at a particular important task, such as UI design, scaling web services, or QA. This leads to the same deficiencies as the restaurant with no specialization: slow, inconsistent delivery.</p>
<p>This is an issue every growing company deals with. So long as the revenue is growing, it suffices to hire people in the needed specialties, and move existing people into more specialized roles within their aptitude. In some cases, the types of people who do well in a small company with no specialization don't do well in a larger one and will leave when the direction becomes clear. That's good for everyone, since they won't fight the trend to an appropriate level of specialization.</p>
<p>The trap is to have a generation of specialists trying to work with the generalists that came before, stepping all over toes and working to different standards.</p>
<h2>Over-specialized</h2>
<p>Large corporations tend to over-specialize. I've seen ten million dollar bowls of cereal because people decided to staff a project with analysts, architects, developers, QA, project management, all for something that should have taken half the number of people. Some efforts only need a few people who can collectively perform 7 or 8 different roles temporarily and as required.</p>
<p>Lacking the ability to identify or retain generalists, the solution corporations often implement is to allocate every practitioner to many projects. You'll get 40% of an analyst's time, 15% of an architect, and so on. This attempts to solve the problem by staffing all 8 roles, but at small allocations so the total project only bills the equivalent of 3 full time people. Of course, as any person who's every been on five projects at 20% can tell you, this solution is largely a terrible accounting fiction.</p>
<h2>One Size Never Fits All</h2>
<p>These problems are perennial issue for any organization, large or small. So what's the solution? As any public service announcement will tell you, "the key is awareness."</p>
<p><em>Organizations should explicitly choose the level of specialization, and review the choice often enough to prevent large failures.</em> You can have people either wearing 6 hats or working on 6 projects for a very short time, but that's the cue to change the game.</p>
<h2>Corporate Trends</h2>
<p>Many corporate technology departments were built around in-house, custom-developed, highly complex solutions. One by one,  enterprise niches are now being served by purchased applications on commodity infrastructure. What used to take analysts, system architects, and a whole set of developers can sometimes be accomplished with a couple of people who can gather requirements, customize a product, and wrangle a quick user acceptance test. In the CRM niche, we have seen the evolution of custom in-house CRM tools to Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>This trend means many corporate technology departments are getting <em>smaller and less specialized.</em> It's hard to let go a good employee because you just don't need that kind of work anymore. And don't think that the existing employees won't see this transition coming.</p>
<p>But the solution is still to evaluate the level of specialization required in each situation and intentionally craft the organization. Corporations have to remember that just because it's more difficult in a shrinking organization than a growing one doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/06/why-enterprise-software-sucks-at-ui.html">Why Enterprise Software Sucks At UI</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I've spent a lot of time around enterprise software. I've used it as part of many jobs, I've purchased it from vendors, and I've built custom applications on top of enterprise software, and produced enterprise software for corporate clients. And I've hated every enterprise UI I've ever seen.</p>
<p>As with many things, monetary incentives drive the form  that enterprise software takes. Just as most software isn't very secure because people can't measure security, enterprise customers won't pay for good UI work. And it's not because the buyers <em>dislike</em> good UI, it's because they don't measure it and don't try.</p>
<p>This is because the purchaser for enterprise software is almost never the final user. They collect a matrix of interests and needs that the product has to fulfill, and then judge different vendor products against the matrix. The IT department needs the product to integrate with all the other crappy software they use. The compliance department needs it to be certified with any regulations or standards that apply. Risk Management needs to know the vendor is a going concern and not likely to go under. Everyone has a column they need to put a tick mark in. The most tick marks gets the sale.</p>
<p>The group of people who would <em>use</em> the software is often represented by a manager one or two levels away from the actual users. There are often literally no actual users present when it is evaluated and the choice is made. Even if there is a single user, there's no veto for a shitty UI like there is for missing a regulation. This just doesn't make it random whether or not the chosen software has a good UI, it drives the market to spend less and less on UI.</p>
<p>Vendors know how purchasing decisions are made, and which missing tick marks will cost them a sale. So all development is oriented towards those features. And once the software is purchased it's very expensive to move away, so people will put up with poor UIs as a matter of practice. Managers will tell you it's your job to use the software — it's not supposed to be fun or delightful.</p>
<p>This is how enterprise software is guaranteed to have poor UI: any dollars and development time going to UI is <em>taken</em> from some feature that one of these enterprise customers need to tick a mark on a comparison sheet. UI work can cost a sale. As long as buyers never ask and can't measure how productive a UI is in a demo, vendors will never spend money on it.</p>
<p>This is another reason I like <a href="/2012/05/simplify-business-models.html">simpler business models</a>. In this case, that would mean the purchaser should also be the user of the software, to make sure you're actually incented to delight the <em>users</em> of the software, not just the <em>purchasers</em> of it.</p>
