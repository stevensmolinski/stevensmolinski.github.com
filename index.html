  <p>Nobody does <em>emotive</em> better than Merlin Mann. When he really feels something, you do too. Even if you don't understand the issue, you get the feel of it. And until just now, his <em><a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/169873399/clackity-noise">Clackity Noise</a></em> post was one I felt more than I understood. </p>
<p>After all (to borrow a Merlinism) isn't it terribly reductive to sieve the meaning of writing into the mere physical act of typing? The physical act of hitting keys on a keyboard is the least important part! Merlin knows better, so why would he focus on the clackity noise?</p>
<h2>How To Sit</h2>
<p>That was four years ago. My subconscious can be fast if it wants to, but it takes its sweet time before it gets its hands around some ideas. The cattle prod on my subconscious was a luxurious resort on the impossibly beautiful Turks and Caicos island. It was an opportunity to read books that hang around on a well-intentioned list. This one was called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Sit-Thich-Nhat-Hanh-ebook/dp/B00IQY3L1M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401540405&amp;sr=8-1">How To Sit</a>. Even if I find much of Buddhist philosophy to be kind of nutty, I can always enjoy a good sit.</p>
<p>What I learned is that meditation is not about sitting. Well, it's all about sitting, and not about sitting at all. Damn, I've just become <em>that guy</em>.</p>
<p>It's really about meditation. And meditation is a great way to clear your mind. But your mind doesn't stay empty; your subconscious will fill it right back up again. With meditation, you can clear the accidental and unimportant, and let your subconscious process the meaningful and important.</p>
<p>Buddhism has been teaching meditation for millennia, and it's learned a thing or two. While I'm no expert, I gleaned some things. First, it's intimidating to have a two step process that says:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sit down.</li>
<li>Achieve enlightenment.</li>
</ol>
<p>So instead, it teaches you a step-by-step method that you can actually achieve. You can sit. You can get comfortable. You can pay attention to your breathing. You can repeat a phrase that stresses the act of relaxing.</p>
<p>You don't need a step that says to let your subconscious fill your mind in with what's really bugging you. That will happen anyway. You need steps to allow you to continue to push things from your conscious mind over and over until the subconscious offers up something worth thinking about. And then you'll think about it anyway. No steps needed for that.</p>
<p>So what Buddhism figured out is to drop the intimidating or automatic mental processes, and describe the physical and the approachable parts. If you do enough sitting, and enough mind-clearing, you will eventually focus on the important.</p>
<p>Sitting on a white sand beach, occasionally watching the repetitive azure ocean lap, this made a lot of sense. A calm beach is practically an invitation to meditation all on its own. It reminded me that I already had a kind of introspection process of my own, similar to meditation but not quite. </p>
<h2>Watching Ink Dry</h2>
<p>I keep an occasional journal with fountain pens. But I don't just write after I've figured out what to write. I often write <em>in order to figure out what to write</em>. I fold over a crisp new page, pick up a wide-nibbed pen with a juicy blue ink, and start writing. </p>
<p>I like to watch the ink dry. Fountain pen ink is water-based, and when it flows well, goes on wet. It sits on the surface of the paper for a few seconds, reflecting a sheen like wet paint. After you're a word or two on, the ink sinks into the paper, getting absorbed into the fibres, losing the sheen and becoming permanent. Sometimes I write a stream of consciousness, just to watch the ink dry as I write past. And before you know it, the words become meaningful.</p>
<p>It's the same principle. Forget the pressure to introspect on something critically important. Just write whatever comes to mind and follow the beautiful sheen on the page.</p>
<h2>Enlightenment</h2>
<p>It's astonishing to me how you can't skip steps in life. How you can't take perfectly good advice to avoid a broken leg until you've already broken it. And how I couldn't have come to an understanding about what Merlin was going on about until I'd had a good stretch of <em>not</em> knowing what he was going on about. About how I couldn't understand meditation's focus on sitting until I'd already found a similar principle by watching ink dry.</p>
<p>So it's always a cycle where I start by not understanding and even turning up my nose at someone's nuttiness. But in time I generally end up seeing where they were coming from. It doesn't always mean agreement — just because you can see the path someone took through the forest doesn't mean it was the smartest path, but at least you have some idea what they've been through.</p>
<p>I'm still looking for more methods to achieve introspection. Just to write this, I had to sit for a time to think. I watched some ink dry in my journal while many of the words found their way onto a page. And finally, I had to make the keys clack until these electrons were all aligned properly. Maybe I'll take a literal walk in the forest later. I don't yet have a path in mind.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2014/03/sculpt-keyboard-review.html">Sculpt Keyboard Review</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>At <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/08/30/sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review">Marco's virtual insistence</a>, I decided to try a Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard. Even those without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> can suffer from poor ergonomics when typing all day, so a design minimizing fatigue and pain is welcome.<br />
</p>
<p>My old solution was to prop up the front of Apple's wireless keyboard to make it flat. I used bits of old cardboard, which would have made Jony Ive blanch. They weren't chamfered or anything.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The Sculpt has some familiarity for those used to Apple's modern aluminium keyboards. The sculpt's keys are similarly low-travel, flat-topped, and silent. The arrow keys, while thankfully almost three times the size of Apple's, are close and tucked into the corner. Every attempt has been made to eliminate unnecessary width, including detaching the number pad and making vertical the control buttons usually on the right hand side. </p>
<p>Even some minor parts of the design have a commendable attention to detail. Both the battery door and stand are attached by magnets rather than fragile plastic tabs. And you don't read much about battery life because it seems to be a solved problem. Battery life is measured in months instead of days or weeks.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>As a heavy <code>vim</code> user, the main compromise is that the top row — including the escape key — are not actual keyboard buttons. They're zero-travel buttons like you'd see on the front of your monitor or TV. With how often I use <code>Esc</code>, the key may wear out before the batteries wear out.</p>
<p>The top row is even more problematic for Mac users. Apple's keyboards use the F-key row for all sorts of different functions than Windows computers, and the only overlap with the Sculpt is the mute and volume keys. All the other special functions are Windows-specific, and don't do anything on the Mac. And if you flip the toggle to use the F-keys, then you lose even the handy ability to easily change the volume.</p>
<h2>Two Weeks In</h2>
<p>Switching to a split keyboard from a regular one quickly shows your unconventional habits, typing keys left of the centerline with the right hand, or vice versa. The more unconventional, the more trouble you'll have with a split keyboard. For me, it's the <code>Y</code>. I often type <code>Y</code> with my left hand, and it's taken time to train the proper way.</p>
<p>The designers have done a great job enlargening the bottom row of keys: Ctrl, Alt, &#8984;, space. You don't need to be very accurate to find the right key. And even though the backspace key is quite large, it <em>feels</em> so far away that it's taken more time to be accurate with. The bottom line is that, while different, there is no large productivity loss. For a coder, often the bottleneck isn't speed of typing, it's the speed of figuring out what to type.</p>
<p>As far as the main purpose of the keyboard: I can report having no fatigue or wrist pain, in situations which might have caused it with my old setup. Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, I know — there have also been no tiger attacks in my office since I purchased the keyboard. While it's a good start, it's only a start. There's a lot more to consider: elevation, posture, distance to the keyboard, and all sorts of other ergonomic factors that feed into pain-free typing. But this keyboard won't get in your way, if that's your goal.</p>
<p>In all, I heartily endorse Marco's hearty endorsement. If they fixed the top row's hardware and functionality problems it would go from being a good keyboard to a great one.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2014/02/cooler-and-harder.html">Cooler and Harder</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>In 2011, Merlin Mann <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk0hSeQ5s_k">talked about being scared</a> about making cool stuff, and doing cool things. And how we shouldn't stop doing harder and cooler things just because we're scared. Everyone is scared, even the successful. Back then I was making things, but they weren't as cool as I liked, and they were locked up behind a corporate wall. Merlin's talk inspired me to be scared of bigger and better things.</p>
<p>Instead of enterprise problems, I'm going to help with problems of actual people. Success won't be a number on a spreadsheet, but a smile on someone's face. That's cool.</p>
<p>Instead of locking up my work inside a corporate owner, I'm going to work on something with a wider audience, out on the open web, where it will stand for itself. That's also cool.</p>
<p>I'm going to use my best judgment, instead of trying to achieve consensus among tens of stakeholders. I'm going to sweat user experience details, even the ones that don't have a measurable ROI. I'm going to use modern technology. I'm going to try and delight my customers.</p>
<p>And I'm not going to have an evil business model. I'm going to make something that people like enough to pay for it. I'm not going to sell anyone up the river.</p>
<p>I expect this to be a hard road. My goal is to work on hard but rewarding problems. At least I know I'll be half right; I'm still only projecting the rewarding part.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/10/withdrawal.html">iPhone Withdrawal</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I don't want to be cliché, but I had to spend a half hour without my phone and it was a bit unsettling. I learned two things, and like most things I learn, both things just opened up more questions.</p>
<h2>Apple Stores Are Awesome</h2>
<p>I learned that Apple stores are wondrous places for customers, quite opposite to most of my experiences as a customer. I had your relatively typical Genius Bar experience, in that I got better service than I expected, and walked away happy.</p>
<p>The speaker on my iPhone 5 had stopped working just that morning, and I had a flight to catch at 1pm. There were no open Genius Bar appointments before my flight left. I went to the store anyway, and pleaded my case. They managed to fit me in and fix my problem with time to spare, all with a smile.</p>
<p>The more interesting questions are around why all customer experiences aren't similar. Marketing budgets are set around how much it costs to get a new customer, but this no-questions-asked service from Apple retains a customer at a fraction of that cost. Great service makes Apple's products stand out even farther than their build quality and design details. The customer experience turns regular people into evangelists to their friends and family. You can't buy that sort of marketing on TV — it comes one customer at a time, paid for with a good retail experience.</p>
<p>So if most businesses are also staring down the large cost of wooing a new customer, why aren't they spending their time carefully crafting the customer experience to keep customers and turn them into walking advertisements? I have guesses, but that's a much bigger topic for another time.</p>
<h2>Am I Addicted To Computing?</h2>
<p>The Apple Genius joked that I had to spend a half hour amusing myself while he replaced the speaker in my iPhone. This is a solid half hour, with literally nothing to do, and no technology whatsoever. He suggested an actual dead-tree newspaper at the coffee shop two doors down, if I were so inclined. </p>
<p>"Remember newspapers?" </p>
<p>"Kind of."</p>
<p>I did go to the coffee shop, but forewent the newspaper. As a big boy with a functioning brain, I should be capable of amusing myself for a half hour. After purchasing a coffee and finding a seat, it took roughly thirty seconds before reflexively reaching into the "iPhone pocket" twice. Not as strong as I had hoped, I snatched my coffee and walked through the mall, hoping that there were enough distracting ladies to keep me amused for … ugh. Twenty. Five. More. Minutes.</p>
<p>Canadians have had the iPhone since the 3G in July, 2008. People like me haven't spent a half-hour without a personal network-connected computer for 4 years and 3 months. That's long enough to build some habits. </p>
<p>It's generally not interesting to read articles about Internet addiction or information addiction. But what I do find interesting is what level of personal computing we should want in our lives. When you realize you're used to having information, communication, and entertainment readily at hand 24 hours a day, is the right reaction to be aghast and to cut down? Or is the right thing to welcome it and hope for smaller, wristwatch sized iPhones next year?</p>
<p>What's interesting is not the reliance on personal computing, but if a modern moral framework will evaluate it as a good thing or not. Was that helpful Apple Genius helping me to have a better life, or a peddler of dependence, giving me a hit for free? That's also a much bigger issue to leave for another day.</p>
<p>(Spoiler: I'll bet they're perfectly moral.)</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/09/Less Bullshit, More Autonomy.html">Less Bullshit and More Autonomy</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I've been exploring the option to work in smaller organizations instead of larger ones because I want less bullshit and more autonomy. That's not just me swearing, it's a very precise statement.</p>
<h2>Too Much Bullshit</h2>
<p>I divide work tasks into three broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Product.</strong> Designing, creating, running, supporting, and maintaining a product that does a job that customers need done.</li>
<li><strong>Support.</strong> Work necessary to support the business that makes the product: accounting, marketing and sales, supply management, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Bullshit.</strong> If it's not in #1 or #2, then it's just bullshit. It can take many forms: useless paperwork, building bridges to unqualified gatekeepers, compensating for poor performers, you name it.</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal is to spend as much time as possible on product, as little time as necessary on support, and <em>exactly zero</em> time on bullshit.</p>
<p>This is where large corporate jobs often fall down. There are stories about new hires that wait for days or weeks to get access to the system they need to perform their job. New processes tend to accrete in a large organization; every problem generates a new form, gate, meeting, or approver. People can impose huge burdens to gather and report data on others with a single sentence email. Designers I worked with used to calculate that they often spent less than two hours per day on product, a few hours a week on support, and the great majority of their time on bullshit.</p>
<h2>Not Enough Autonomy</h2>
<p>Decision-making in large organizations is often dysfunctional. Few executives understand delegation. They retain approval on minutia often without understanding the effort (i.e., cost) involved in gaining approval from someone without any time or domain knowledge.</p>
<p>Organizational structure will always place a large number of constraints on a product designer. The product has to perform the customer's job but also it must be profitable, be saleable through a channel, meet regulatory approval, etc. But those constraints can be met with low or high friction processes. </p>
<p>Low friction would be to educate and delegate responsibility to meet all these factors to the lead product designer. For example, a Privacy Compliance office could send a representative to describe privacy requirements and to help the product designer understand compliance issues. These emissaries would act as advisors and contributors. This method leaves the product designer in the driver's seat, even though other groups help to set the road.</p>
<p>Sadly what often happens is for each group to impose a gate on the product design process. Each group wants a veto. Each group wants to be brought up to speed on the whole product in order to evaluate it. Instead of advisors guiding the lead designer, you get a committee of people who are only empowered to say "no". This method places the constraints <em>above</em> the product design process itself.</p>
<h2>The Full Picture</h2>
<p>If your focus is on helping customers, then you will want to focus on product. Too often corporate jobs are less than 10% product, and even then you're navigating a gauntlet of managers who are only allowed to stop development. These are not organizations with a <a href="http://dangerinc.ca/2011/03/effort-culture-vs-product-culture.html">product culture</a>.</p>
<p>These jobs may pay for 40 hours per week, but you feel like you've done 4 hours of good work, and spend the other 36 getting permission to do it. So to be <em>productive</em>, I suggest finding organizations with less bullshit and more autonomy. That's what I'm doing.</p>
