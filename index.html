    <h1><a href="/2012/05/greed-isnt-the-issue.html">Greed Isn't The Issue</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>I tend to roll my eyes when people blame a high price on corporate greed. It's especially roll-worthy when these same people go comparison shopping on sites all over the world to get the lowest price for something.</p>
<p>A transaction has two sides, each side trying to get the best deal. For the buyer, it means getting the most product for your money. For the seller, it means getting the most money for your product.</p>
<p>It's terribly hypocritical for a person on one side of the transaction to maximize their return (say, by comparison shopping), but denigrate a seller's effort to maximize by charging what the market will bear. I'm not talking about defrauding people. I'm just talking about charging what people will pay.</p>
<p>People engaged in economic activity will try to make sure they get the best deal they can reasonably find, or at least will choose transactions they think aren't ripoffs (which is the same thing). That way, when both parties agree on a sale, both feel like they are better off for having made the transaction. One party wanted the item more than their money, and the other wanted the money more than the thing. So they exchanged. That's how it works.</p>
<p>It's one of the beautiful symmetries in life that it works the same no matter which side of the transaction you're on. The fact that <em>each person feels they've gained</em> by the trade is why it works. Mutual exchange for mutual benefit is the basis for specialization and a society with all our modern conveniences. And I <em>like</em> modern conveniences.</p>
<p>So the real issue isn't "greed" at all, since that would describe anyone trying to get the most for their money as well. A proper morality is not some naïve and self-contradictory altruism. Blaming anything on "greed" is a sign that a person needs to work out a better moral understanding of themselves and the people around them.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/simplify-business-models.html">Simplify Business Models</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>There's something pure about the simple "two-party sale" business model: a customer pays money to a producer to purchase a product. It's a one-time transaction. The entire value the producer gets is the agreed price. The entire value for the customer is the product. The producer gets the money outright, and the customer gets the product outright. Assuming there is no fraud or defect in the product or the payment, there is no more to the transaction.</p>
<p>It's <em>pure</em> because it's easy to understand. And as either a customer or a producer, it's easy to "calculate" the value you need out of the transaction. Producers can figure out what minimum price they need to make enough profit to continue their operations, and what maximum price the market will bear. Each customer can imagine the use they have for the product, and decide what cash value they're willing to part with to get it. There are very few variables, and each party can understand the variables they need to enter into a transaction.</p>
<h1>It's Often Not That Simple</h1>
<p>There are few businesses with such simple models. The stickers and adware on new PCs are ugly, user-hostile reminders that the PC-maker has other customers than the person who buys the computer. Product placement in TV and movies are reminders that producers had other customers than the audience to please.</p>
<p>The principle is that another source of revenue represents another customer with unique needs. This means your project isn't just serving a single "job to be done". Whenever you get away from the pure model of 1 customer and 1 producer per transaction, you get complicated interactions of what jobs different people are hiring your product to do. Like waves in a pool they can interact in interesting ways.</p>
<h1>Advertising Complicates Transactions</h1>
<p>Advertising makes for an antagonistic interaction of the jobs to be done by each customer. Take blogging as an example. The advertiser is a customer of the blogger, along with the reader. The reader pays no money for articles, but he does pay with his attention. Attention won't pay the blogger's bills, but it can be resold to advertisers. The advertiser gets no real value from the producer's product, but they will pay for the reader's attention. Except the reader doesn't need the advertisement. At all.</p>
<p>Without the reader, the advertiser doesn't care. Without the advertiser, the producer can't get enough cash out of readers. It's a tenuous balance.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that some customers get ignored with all these interacting expectations? I have always been involved in business with complex customer-producer relationships, and the complexity has been problematic in each one. Even if the serving one customer doesn't directly hurt another (and often it does), it will at the very least take focus. </p>
<p>No one expects all relationships to be easy, but I will keep this in mind the next business that I start: I would like a clear relationship where all my customers have the same job to be done.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/first-order-management.html">First-Order Management</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>The great thing about learning a principle is applying it to new and novel problems. I often get to apply principles from system architecture to my newer challenges in organizational and management problems.</p>
<p>I have recently been thinking about how principles in performance optimization of programs can sometimes apply to the performance of people. I'll introduce the principle as I learned it, and then apply it to a common management problem.</p>
<h1>Optimization Is Hard</h1>
<p>There are a class of very common errors that developers often make when diagnosing performance problems. A well-meaning developer will hook up a profiler to a problematic bit of code to see what routines are taking too much time. They'll pick a routine that has a large  percent of runtime, and try to tweak the code to get it to run faster. Many of these tweaks only work for special case data, or on special case hardware, or need special compiler treatment. And often they only provide a few percentage points of improvement.</p>
<p>The experienced developers have learned that there is a way to get much better improvements over a larger set of circumstances. Algorithmic and architecture changes regularly offer improvements an order of magnitude better than the original solution. The answer to a slow piece of code is often not to run it at all. As a simplified example, instead of speeding up ten slow database calls, it may be possible to rewrite the program to just use one call, or even eliminate runtime database lookups entirely.</p>
<p>The problem with the profiler method is <em>using a solution that's easy to measure, but not the most impactful</em>. A profiler won't tell you about the health of your algorithm or architecture. It won't reveal a new O(n log n) solution to your problem instead of the O(n**2) one that you're trying to speed up.</p>
<h1>The Principle</h1>
<p>In system development, you learn that algorithms and architectures are first-order determinants of program performance, and detailed implementation tricks are lower-order. The principle is to <em>exhaust first-order solutions before spending time on the less impactful lower-order solutions</em>.</p>
<h1>Management Reports Are Profilers</h1>
<p>The same trap catches managers, and in the same way. They have tools to measure some aspects of performance of practitioners, projects, or whole departments. Like code profilers, they only measure the people that are there (as opposed to the people that <em>could</em> be there), and they only measure things that are easy to measure; there is no number for skill or teamwork. </p>
<p>In software development, the <em>people</em>&thinsp;—&thinsp;their skills and teamwork&thinsp;—&thinsp;are a first order determinant of project success. Choosing the right people is as important as choosing the right algorithm in software development: you can literally get ten times the performance with a better choice.</p>
<p>But often managers only consider the easily measurable metrics produced by their team. You can produce a 10% increase in an underperforming practitioner by sending them to a course. They learn a thing or two, come back unburdened and recharged, and they try harder for a time. Maybe. But if that person produces one tenth of the person you <em>could</em> hire, then it's not the best use of management effort.</p>
<p>But, like the developer with the profiling report, these managers can show small percentage increases in their chosen metric. Also like the developer, there is no report that shows the tenfold increase possible only to a different approach. It's easy to measure training days, and correlate it to a minor percent increase in code commits. It's easy, but it's not the most effective strategy.</p>
<h1>What To Do?</h1>
<p>So what is a manager to do? You don't throw away your metrics. In any business you need some type of metrics, and they should be directly linked to the firm's profitability. But you should figure out what are first-order determinants of those results, and manage those, even if they're hard or impossible to measure.</p>
<p>Don't commit to metrics that are too limiting. If you measure training days, you're buying into the idea that training days is a worthwhile eventual indicator of profitability. You could manage that brilliantly and still fail, because training days are a minor determinant of success compared with skill and teamwork. Picking a wider measurement such as "project success" or "revenue" will enable you to make decisions more broadly about your first-order factors. That way you're not painted into a corner or managing the wrong variables.</p>
<p>And if you're an IT Manager, spend as much time as possible on getting the right people, and getting rid of the wrong people. The "right" people might be hard to measure on a report, but you're better off focusing on it as best you can instead of micro-managing metrics that hardly matter.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/04/belated-praise-for-launchd.html">Belated Praise for Launchd</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>This is way behind the times, but I recently had to automate a task on Mac OS X, and decided to deploy it using <code>launchd</code> instead of <code>cron</code>. I expected to find it an XML-enabled <code>cron</code> clone, or worse. I was happily very wrong.</p>
<h1>The Good</h1>
<p>The first surprise was a set of relatively good man pages. They don't contain every single detail, but some experimentation and some <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">stack exchange</a> got the job done.</p>
<p><code>Launchd</code> improves on <code>cron</code> for deployment: one file per job is an improvement over the <code>crontab</code>. I have implemented a similar system over <code>cron</code> before, where you drop individual <code>crontab</code>-formatted files into a directory, and they're all picked up and added into the user's <code>crontab</code> file. It's nice to get that for free with <code>launchd</code>.</p>
<p>Apple also implemented far more event triggers than <code>cron</code>, which only implements a clock. <code>Launchd</code> replaces <code>crond</code>, <code>inetd</code>, and most importantly to me, filesystem event triggers.</p>
<p>There are also configuration elements for a few practices that were commonly done in code. For example, <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> redirection to a file, so you don't have to do that sort of magic in your program. You can configure the working directory or <code>chroot</code> of your program instead of being dumped into <code>/</code>, which is nice. And, if it's running under the system, you can configure the user and group that the program should use.</p>
<p>All this means that one can write a very simple bash script instead of a cron-specific, boilerplate-filled mess. It's easy to make it so the script can be run interactively when needed, without adding too many options.</p>
<h1>The Bad</h1>
<p>Mac OS X's default configuration file format is the plist. It's XML and it takes a good long time to say anything. I'm not crazy about it, compared with formats that are friendlier to type. Grudgingly I'll admit it's not too painful to use XCode to make them, since you don't have to remember the boilerplate or schema.</p>
<h1>The Ugly?</h1>
<p>I don't have enough experience yet with it to have anything ugly to report. It's quite possible I'll never get enough experience with it, as I expect to write more code for servers than clients, and I historically have preferred non-Darwin unixes for server duties.</p>
<p>But I can say that I will miss some of the flexibility of <code>launchd</code> the next time I find myself using <code>cron</code> to schedule a job when I really want a filesystem-based trigger.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/04/dont-hate-the-customer.html">Don't Hate The Customer</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>There are some lessons that sound trivial but need reinforcement as often as possible. Just the other day I overheard some peers telling stories about annoying customers and it irked me. They needed a reminder that you're in business to help and to please your customers.</p>
<p>Almost any job can make you hate your customer. They're the people that bother you on a daily basis. They have unreasonable demands. They don't understand your job, and expect you to cater to their needs, regardless of how inconvenient they may be.</p>
<h1>Corporate Customers</h1>
<p>In a corporate setting it's rampant to dislike the customer. At least in retail, the customer is generally a person with a handful of cash. You may not like them, but it's easy to see how a happy customer adds to your personal success. In a corporation, your immediate customer is often another employee who is forced to use your service whether or not it sucks. You may not even know anyone who has talked to a real, flesh-and-wallet customer of the company. For most people there's no obvious link between pleasing your customer and earning money.</p>
<p>In technical fields a poor attitude towards customers leads to all kinds of failures. We expect customers to adapt to technology instead of the other way around. We expect customers to learn our internal processes, instead of catering to their time and expectations. We drag them through hardware and software upgrades that require more effort than they're worth.</p>
<h1>Learning From Jewelers</h1>
<p>As an IT professional, I was pleasantly astounded by a jeweler who made me some custom pieces. I was led through a set of stages, including some with the very technical component of assessing gemstones from a third party. In all cases my time was respected, and the jeweler involved me in decision-making as a consultant should. The end result did not surprise or disappoint me in its cost, time, or quality.</p>
<p>When we had to make a technical decision that was out of my depth, she explained enough of the principles involved and put forward a reasoned recommendation based on her expertise, backed up with a few key points of rationale. I felt sufficiently involved despite not having the technical background to make the decision on my own. When decisions were insignificant, I wasn't even bothered with them.</p>
<h1>More Similar Than Different</h1>
<p>The jeweler is in the same situation as any technical professional: serving a non-technical customer with little understanding of the process, components, or challenges of the project. Any professional has a choice: either to resent the customer's ignorance, or to become a proper consultant and lead them to their goal.</p>
<p>Large IT projects are bigger and more complex, but the goal should be the same. The customer has a budget, an outcome they want, and a few key concerns. It shouldn't be any harder in IT to advise a customer, lead them through a process, and involve them appropriately. At the end, they should not be surprised by the cost, time, or quality of the result.</p>
